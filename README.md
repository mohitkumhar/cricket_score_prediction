# Cricket Score Prediction using Machine Learning

This project aims to predict cricket match scores based on historical data, team statistics, and match conditions. Using various machine learning algorithms, the model provides accurate score predictions for T20 matches.

## Features
- Predicts cricket match scores based on multiple parameters
- Utilizes historical data and team statistics for better accuracy
- Implements machine learning models to improve prediction reliability
- User-friendly web application built using Streamlit

## Web Application
The live web application can be accessed here:  
[Cricket Score Prediction](https://t20-score-prediction.streamlit.app/)
